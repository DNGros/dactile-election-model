- 7/28: Fix where the averages rendered in the article for Biden 2020/2024 did
        not filter for "full_days".
        The "full_days" filters out early days in the election where not the full span of days.
        This now better matches the actual values used in the model.
        While these displayed average numbers change ~0.1 point, the
        topline estimates should be unchanged (as that was always filtering)
- 7/30: Fix improper weighting when the end date was
        after the dropout day but the start date was not. Slight adjustment
        in poll count show in main text. Did not appear to change top-line on
        this date (either because change small enough or because it two different code paths)
