- 7/28: Fix where the averages rendered in the article for Biden 2020/2024 did
        not filter for "full_days".
        The "full_days" filters out early days in the election where not the full span of days.
        This now better matches the actual values used in the model.
        While these displayed average numbers change ~0.1 point, the
        topline estimates should be unchanged (as that was always filtering)
